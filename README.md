## Getting started

Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) on your system. Then install the project dependencies via

```
npm install
```

To compile and run the program use

```
npm run cli
```

Tests are written with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/). Run them via

```
npm run test
```

If you want to an IDE like [Webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) to run them, make sure to enable
[ECMAScript Module support](https://jestjs.io/docs/ecmascript-modules) by setting `--experimental-vm-modules`.
